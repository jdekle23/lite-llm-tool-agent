# 🔧 LiteLLM Tool Agent

> A minimal Python AI agent that performs real tasks by calling Python functions (aka tools).  
> Built using [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) with full support for tool-calling, memory, and safe termination.

## 🤖 What This Project Does

This script demonstrates how to build a **tool-using AI agent** that:
- 📁 Lists files in the current working directory
- 📖 Reads the contents of a selected file
- ✅ Gracefully terminates itself with a summary message

It simulates a minimal autonomous AI system using OpenAI's GPT-4o via LiteLLM's simple Python SDK.

## 🧠 Agent Workflow

1. The user gives a task (e.g., “Read the README”)
2. The agent first lists available files
3. It then reads the specified file
4. It ends by summarizing the task and terminating itself
